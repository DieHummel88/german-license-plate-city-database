# german-license-plate-city-database

This DB (or rather table) is a list of the 2-3 letter prefixes for license plates of german cars with the name of the area or city they belong to.

I wasn't able to export this table as INSERT statements and I couldn't be bothered to try even more often. If you can do it your help is appreciated.
